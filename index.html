        <h3>About Reclaimed Harvest</h3>
        <img src="img/me.jpg" alt="Photograph of Hannah Westheimer" class="profile-photo">
        <p>Hi, I'm Hannah and I live in West Philadelphia. When I first moved to the city I was struck with how much “garbage” was all around me. On trash days sidewalks become filled with items heading to landfills. Wooden pallets, used to transport goods, litter the streets outside of businesses and restaurants.  Reclaimed Harvest takes what is considered trash and turns it into a container garden that will produce a bountiful harvest. I founded Reclaimed Harvest as a way to help others grow food in limited space using pallets. </p>

      <h3>What is a Pallet Garden?</h3>
        <p>Food can be grown in just about any container. Growing food in reclaimed items, like pallets, means that we are reducing the amount of trash taken to the landfill while giving city residents the option to produce their own food. I use shipping pallets that I find on the street (making sure the wood was never treated chemically and is safe to work with and grow food in), install landscaping fabric on the back, place a drip hose inside for easy watering, and I fill it with good quality potting soil. Next I choose what plants to grow in my pallet garden and in a few weeks I enjoy the harvest!
